date: <date here>

1) What is a variable?
A variable is a named memory location that stores data and value.


2) Are variable names case-sensitive? Is a variable named a the same as a variable named A?
Variable names are case-sensitive which means that an uppercase letter is not the same as a lowercase letter. So, "A" as a part of a variable name is not the same as "a".


3) What characters are you allowed to use in a variable name?
You can use characters such as lowercase a-z, uppercase A-Z, numbers 0-9, and underscores(_).


3) Can a variable that originally holds a string hold a different type later on?



4) Can you save the contents of one variable to another? Example:
    x = 5
    y = x
   What is the value of y?
The value of y would be whatever the current value of x is at the time. In the case y would be 5 because at the moment, x's value is 5. 


5) Does using the variable in an operation cause the variable's value to change? How can you cause a variable's value
    to change?



6) Why do we use variables, what is their purpose?



7) What is the difference between a literal and a variable?



8) Why are we allowed to write the code x = x + 5, when in math this would be a contradiction?
